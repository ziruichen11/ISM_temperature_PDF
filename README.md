# ISM_temperature_PDF

This repository contains an annotated notebook that uses the modified Langevin model developed by Chen et al. 2025 to generate temperature PDFs of the turbulent, multi-phase ISM. Our model takes a Lagrangian 
approach to stochastically evolve an ensemble of fluid elements subject to turbulent mixing and diffusion and ISM cooling and heating processes. For more details of the model, please refer to the annotated notebook 
and our paper.
